# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to automate the identification of common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It helps security professionals and developers discover and address potential threats to their web applications.

Key Features:
- SQL Injection (SQLi) detection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) detection
- Directory Traversal/File Inclusion detection
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) detection
- Insecure Deserialization detection
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) detection
- Custom payload support
- Authentication simulation
- Crawling and spidering
- Comprehensive reporting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vuln-scanner.git
   cd web-vuln-scanner

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

    Start a scan by specifying the target URL:
python scanner.py -t <target_url>

Replace <target_url> with the URL of the web application you want to scan.

Configure optional parameters for advanced scanning: 
python scanner.py -t <target_url> -o <output_format> -p <payload_file> -a <auth_credentials> -c


        -o <output_format>: Specify the output format for the report (e.g., html, pdf, json).
        -p <payload_file>: Provide a custom payloads file for testing specific vulnerabilities.
        -a <auth_credentials>: Simulate user authentication by providing username and password.
        -c: Enable crawling and spidering for comprehensive scanning coverage.

    Review the scan report:
    Once the scan is completed, the tool will generate a report containing vulnerability details, severity levels, and remediation recommendations in the specified format.
